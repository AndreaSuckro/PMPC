Galton (1907) went to a fair and observed a simple guessing game. There was a bull displayed and you could get a price if you guessed the right weight of it. Galton had a look at all guesses and found, that the knowledge of the mass could display the real value for the bull's weight (1198 lbs) pretty good as can be seen in the following graph:

\sidenote{Another famous example: the German Tank Problem.}
In 2006 Griffiths \& Tenenbaum did a ``simple'' Bayesian inference with ``real-world'' priors and only one data point. An example for this is the distribution of age of death of men in Germany.

      \addplot[domain=2:10, color=red, samples=50, smooth, yshift=0.1cm] {gauss(7,1)};

Assume the following two scenarios.
\begin{itemize}
	\item You meet someone who is 25 years old. When will he die? In this case you have to go with your prior, which then is your posterior.
  \item You meet someone who is 85 years old. When will he die? Every age below 85 is now not possible any more, you have to update your prior.
\end{itemize}

When X is the total value and Y the observed value, P(X) is our prior. It follows that:
\begin{align*}
& P(Y=y|X=x) & = \frac{1}{X}\cdot I(y\leq x) & & \rightarrow I~is~1~if~y\leq x ; 0~otherwise\\
& P(X=x|Y=y) & = \frac{P(Y=y|X=x) \cdot P(X=x)}{P(Y=y)} & &\\
& & =  \frac{\frac{1}{X}I(y\leq x)p(X=x)}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{X}I(y\leq x)p(X=x)dx} & &\\
& & =  \frac{\frac{1}{X}I(y\leq x)p(X=x)}{\int_{y}^{\infty}\frac{p(X=x)}{X}dx} & &
\end{align*}
