\textbf{\large Dear reader,}

\smallskip

These notes were originally taken during the summer semester 2014. We hope they are helpful while following along the course in the future, although they are partly incomplete, riddled, or really just a quick scribble of what was on the board.

Sadly we didn't write down all exercise solutions, however you should try to solve them yourself anyway.

If you find any mistakes, contact us or correct them if possible.

Feel free to take our notes and adapt them to your semester as well -- or just expand this document.

\smallskip

We hope you enjoy reading the notes as much as we enjoyed writing and discussing them.
