sheet 5 ex 5

1. since p < 0.01 it's not absolutely disproved
2. they don't find the probability of the NH $p(q=\frac{1}{2}|H=h,n=25)$ but instead they find $p(H>20|q=\frac{1}{2},n=25)$, the p-value. which is not sufficient to know 
3. like 1
4. p(q>\frac{1}{2}|H=h,n=25) not possible as frequentist: you need Bayes' rule
5. you need to know the type 2 error, but without q that is not possible
6. nobody can tell what happens if we repeat the experiment
7. this is the only true sentence
