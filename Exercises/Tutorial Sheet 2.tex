\section*{Exercise 2}
The union-bound can be proved by induction.\\
\\
$Basis:$
For $n=1$ we have
\begin{align}
& & P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{1}(E_i)) & \leq \sum_{i=1}^{1}(P(E_i)) & & \\
\Leftrightarrow & & P(E_1) & = P(E_1) & & 
\end{align}
\\
$Inductive Step:$
We know that $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$, so it follows that:
\begin{align}
& & P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n+1}(E_i)) & = P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(E_i)) + P(E_{n+1}) - P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(E_i) \cap A_{n+1}) & &
\end{align}
\\
Now since $P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(E_i) \cap E_{n+1})$ is a probability, by the first axiom of probability we know that it is bigger or equal to zero:\\
\begin{align}
 P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(E_i) \cap E_{n+1}) \geq 0 
\end{align}
\\
By adding it to both sides of the inequality we get:\\
\begin{align}
& & P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n+1}(E_i)) + P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(E_i) \cap E_{n+1}) & = P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(E_i)) + P(E_{n+1})  & &
\end{align}
\\
And therefore we know:
\begin{align}
& & P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n+1}(E_i)) \leq P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}(E_i)) + P(E_{n+1})  & &
\end{align}
This is equvialent to:
\begin{align}
& & P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n+1}(E_i)) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}(P(E_i) + P(E_{n+1})) & = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(P(E_i)) & &
\end{align}
\\

\section*{Exercise 3}

\begin{align}
P(A|B) & = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\
Posterior & = \frac{Likelihood \cdot Prior}{Evidence}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
\frac{P(A|B)}{P(not A|B)} & = \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B|not A)} \cdot \frac{P(A)}{P(not A)} \\
Posterior & = Likelihoodratio \cdot Prior
\end{align}

\section*{Exercise 4}

We take Bayes' rule to calculate $P(\mbox{Blue Car}|\mbox{Testified by Witness})$
\begin{align}
P(B|T) = \frac{P(T|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(T)}
\end{align}
We know that $P(T|B) = 0.8$ and $P(B) = 0.15$, so we only have to find out $P(T)$. Therefore we marginalize over B:
\begin{align}
\sum_{B}{P(T|B) \cdot P(B)} = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.29
\end{align}
Now we can take our values and calculate the correct answer:
\begin{align}
P(B|T) = \frac{P(T|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(T)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = 0.414
\end{align}
\\
When testing a large group of people is asked, the common mistake becomes obvious that they take the probability that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors, which is 80\%, as the probability that is asked for.

\section*{Exercise 5}

We take Bayes' rule to calculate $P(\mbox{Cancer}|\mbox{Positive Test})$
\begin{align}
P(C|P) = \frac{P(P|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(P)}
\end{align}
We know that $P(P|C) = 0.5$ and $P(C) = 0.003$, so we only have to find out $P(P)$. Therefore we marginalize over C:
\begin{align}
\sum_{C}{P(P|C) \cdot P(C)} = 0.5 \cdot 0.003 + 0.03 \cdot 0.997 = 0.0314
\end{align}
Now we can take our values and calculate the correct answer:
\begin{align}
P(C|P) = \frac{P(P|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(P)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.003}{0.0314} = 0.048
\end{align}

As we can see, only 4.8\% of the people being tested positively actually have cancer. Nevertheless screening is a good thing because out of 1000 detections still 50 have cancer and those can be treated which probably makes up for the disadvantage of having 950 false alarms.

\section*{Exercise 7}

As the probability for each door to contain a car is equal we know that our chance to win is given by $P(\mbox{Win}) = \frac{1} 3$\\
Further the probability that the Quiz-master chooses one of the remaining doors is
$P(\mbox{Open}) = \frac{1} 2$\\
The Quiz-master would not open the door which contains the car so: \\
$P(\mbox{notOpen }|\mbox{Win}) = 1$\\
Now if calculate the probability of the car being behind the not opened door using Bayes' we get:
\begin{align}
& & P(Win|notOpen) & = \frac{P(notOpen|Win) \cdot P(Win)}{P(notOpen)} & = \frac{1 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} &= \frac{2}{3}& &
\end{align}
\\
Therefore the probability that the car is behind the door that the Quiz-master did not open is $\frac{2}{3}$ while the probability of our first chosen door still is $\frac{1}{3}$. So we would double our chances to win by changing our choice.
