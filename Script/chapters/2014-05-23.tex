What is calibration?

80\% of the statements you marked with 80\% should be true. Then you are well-calibrated.





% write something better
psychological effects: overestimation, overestimation of small probabilities

once you know that stuff you can use it to correct peoples answers or estimates to certain events






Binary random variable
i.e. in Osnabr√ºck there are children born, 0 if they are boys, 1 if they are girls.
$x=x_1,x_2,x_3,...,x_n \Rightarrow 01011001$
$P(X|q) = q^{x_1} (1-q)^{1-x_1} \cdot q^{x_2}(1-q)^{1-x_2} = \prod\limits_{i=1}^{n}{q^{x_i}(1-q)^{1-x_i}} = q^{num(1)}(1-q)^{num(0)}$ with $num(Y)$ as the number of occurences of Y

Bernoulli experiment

Now we want to know $P(q|X) = \frac{P(X|q)P(q)}{P(X)} = \frac{P(X|q)P(q)}{\int\limits_0^1 p(X|q)p(q) dq}$
