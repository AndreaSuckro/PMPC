\subsection{Probabilities of Continuous Random Variables}
How tall is Frank JÃ¤kel? 1.80m, 1.70m, 1.68m, 1.69m, or even 1.7034241m?

Not only are there problems with real numbers like 1.7034241, but also with the question the Bayesian view inevitably asks: ``What do you think is the probability for that size?''

One sees: continuous random variables are difficult. There is an infinite uncountable range of numbers and one shall assign probabilities for them. This leads straight to the question: ``What's the probability of a real number?''

In the following section this problem gets tackled in three ways.

\subsubsection[Probability Density Function (PDF)]{Solution 1: Histograms (Probability Density Function, PDF)}
The first and naive way is to discretize the sample space $\mathbb{R}$ into bins and assign probabilities to those bins.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

  % horizontal axis
  \draw[->] (0, 0) -- (5.5, 0);
  % ticks horizontal
  \foreach \x in {0,...,5}
    \draw (\x,1pt) -- (\x,-3pt);
  % labels horizontal
  \draw	(0,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {1.4}
		    (1,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {1.5}
		    (2,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {1.6}
		    (3,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {1.7}
		    (4,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {1.8}
		    (5,-0.1) node[anchor=north] {1.9}
        ;
  % axis label
  \draw (2.5,-0.8) node {height in $m$};
  
  % vertical axis
  \draw[->] (0, 0) -- (0, 2.5);
  % ticks vertical
  \foreach \y in {0,0.5,1,1.5,2}
    \draw (1pt, \y) -- (-3pt, \y);
  % labels vertical
  \draw (-0.2,0.0) node[anchor=east]  {0}
        (-0.2,0.5) node[anchor=east]  {2.5}
        (-0.2,1.0) node[anchor=east]  {5}
        (-0.2,1.5) node[anchor=east]  {7.5}
        (-0.2,2.0) node[anchor=east] {10}
        ;
  % axis label
  \draw (-1,1) node[rotate=90] {density};
  
  % first box
  \draw[thick] (1, 0) -- (1, 0.2) -- (2, 0.2) -- (2, 0);
  % second box
  \draw[thick] (2, 0) -- (2, 1.4) -- (3, 1.4) -- (3, 0);
  % third box
  \draw[thick] (3, 0) -- (3, 0.4) -- (4, 0.4) -- (4, 0);
  
  % box labels
  \draw (1.5, 0.7) node{$10 \%$};
  \draw (2.5, 0.7) node{$70 \%$};
  \draw (3.5, 0.7) node{$20 \%$};
  
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Note that \textbf{the area describes the probability}. For the second box, we would assign a y-value of 7, such that the width (0.1) times the height equals the probability ($0.1\cdot 7 = 0.7$).

\textit{From here on it's just notes for the rest of this section, working on it!}

Histogram! -> Limit of the histogram: Probability density function (PDF)
Make discrete space: 150-160, 160-170, etc.
Assign probabilities to those bins.
Change resolution (150-155, 155-160), reassign/reorder 

this is the density (and it's = 1 (area/integral))

two weird extreme cases:
- reassigning/reordering causes high densities
- equally distributed density causes probability of 0 for each exact number
   - however, you can calculate the probability for intervals with the integral
   -> you only want to bet on intervals

\subsubsection[Cumulative Density Function (CDF)]{Solution 2: Cumulative Density Function, CDF}
CDF is the integral of the PDF
 % rest see paper notes

\subsubsection{Solution 3: Parametric Distribution}
We use the Gaussian distribution

\begin{align*}
p(X=x) &= \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}\right)^2} = \phi(x;\mu,\sigma) = \phi\left(\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma};0,1\right) \\
\frac{\mu-x}{\sigma}&=z \\
P(X \leq t) &= \int\limits_{-\infty}^{t}{p(X=x)} dx = \Phi(t;\mu,\sigma) \\
\mbox{probability of the standard deviation: } \\
P(\mu\sigma \leq X \leq \mu + \sigma) &= \Phi(\mu+\sigma;\mu,\sigma) - \Phi(\mu-\sigma;\mu,\sigma) \approx 68\%
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\mu \pm \sigma \approx 68\%$
	\item $\mu \pm 2\sigma \approx 95\%$
	\item $\mu \pm 3\sigma \approx 99\%$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proper Scoring Rules}
Multiple choice test: better to say: ``How is your belief that this is right''

Example: EU pop > US pop? X = 1 if true, X = 0 if false

aim: high gain if true and high q, no gain if high q but false etc.

q is what you say your belief is 
\begin{align*}
L(X,q) &= (X-q)^2 \\
       &= X^2-2qX+q^2 \mbox{ note: $X^2 = X$, since only 1 or 2} \\
       &= X(1-2q)+q^2
\end{align*}

You lie: Your true belief is p, but you say q.

For best performance on test minimize expected loss $E(L(X,q)) = p(1-2q)+q^2$

p is ``a bet on $p\cdot num$ of questions are true'', so that's why the expected loss is like this

Minimize E: $1^{st}$ derivative:
\begin{align*}
E(L(X,q)) &= p(1-2q)+q^2 \\
\frac{\partial E}{\partial q}E(L(X,q)) &= -2p + 2q \\
\Leftrightarrow p = q
\end{align*}
